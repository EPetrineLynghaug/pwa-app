# 	Lecture Notes: Progressive Web App (PWA). 


## Description
This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed and run on your computer. The main goal is to provide an experience that feels like a native application, with fast performance and support for offline functionality. The application works best in Chrome, but has partial support in Firefox and Safari, with some limitations.”

## Key Features of Web Workers

  - **Simple Setup:**  Express is easy to install and configure, making it a great choice for lightweight applications.
  - **Middleware Support:**  It offers support for middleware, allowing you to handle requests and responses more efficiently by layering different functionalities.
  - **Routing:** Express simplifies the handling of multiple routes in an organized manner.
  - **Asynchronous Performance:** Non-blocking behavior ensures that the server can handle multiple requests efficiently.
  - **Built on Top of Node.js:** It leverages the power of Node.js without interfering with its core, providing a flexible environment for developers.
  - 
  - **Save as an app:** The application can be installed and stored on your device, allowing you to use it without opening a browser.
  - **Offline functionality:** The PWA downloads the necessary resources the first time you use the app and stores them locally (via cache). This allows you to use the app even when you are offline.
  - **Push notifications:** The application supports push notifications, which can be received even if the app is not open. Push notifications run in the background and keep you updated with new information.
  - **Fast performance:** Since the application is cached locally, it starts up quickly and is available almost immediately.
  - **Native-like experience:** The goal is to provide the user with an experience similar to a native mobile or desktop app, with minimal wait time and seamless use.

## Disadvantages of Express

<details>

1. **No Built-in Features:** Unlike some other frameworks, Express doesn’t come with a lot of features out of the box, which means you need to build or integrate them manually.
2. **No Built-in Database Support:** : Express doesn’t include a database system, so you need to manage databases separately, for instance, by using Node.js with a database like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
